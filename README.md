# <em>azk• Don't miss a task.</em>

###### AZK• is still a work in progress.

When you are a Freelancer working by the hour, you have to spend a lot of time inputting data, measuring  and anlyzing it. If you're in a team of Freelancers, things get even more complicated. If you are doing it in MS Excel, oh man. Aiming to reduce errors and time spent on task management, I created azk• (which is on its second version, already).

## Creation and development

### Approaching the problem

Well, since the problem was mine and from other professionally close people, it was a little easier to make the reasearch and to discover new problems, as it usually is (also, since this is a small, non comercial project that will be used by few people). Here's a list of both things that have to be accomplished every month, regarding each client and task, and problems that were persistent:

#### Activities:
• Register new and existing clients, each with its available hours, payment and currency;<br>
• Register new individual tasks, each with its date, client, description and duration;<br>
• Analyse total hours, by client and date;

#### Common problems:
• Freelancers exceed the monthly workload allowed for each client;<br>
• Some tasks were left behind and not paid;<br>
• Information was lost;<br>

#### User behaviour:
• Used mostly (I actually never input tasks from my phone) on desktop PCs both by day and night times;<br>
• Daily input of tasks;<br>
• Monthly hour and payment analysis;<br>
